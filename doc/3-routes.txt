** Juno Routes
==============

    * Basics
    --------

    Juno lets you assign functions to a given url by using python decorators:
        
        from juno import *

        @route('/hello/')
        def hello(web): return "Hello there"

    The url argument given to the decorator is where this function will be located;
    so going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/ will let you see your work.


    * Multiple URLs for the Same View
    ---------------------------------

    You can replace that one url in the route() function with a list of strings,
    like so:
        
        @route(['/', '/index/'])

    This lets you send multiple addresses to one view.

    
    * Getting the Reqeust Method Involved
    -------------------------------------

    But what if you want a view to only respond to POST requests? You could do this:
        
        @route('/probably_a_form/', 'post')
        def form_read(web): ...

    Since thats pretty verbose, theres a shortcut:
        
        @post('/probably_a_form/')
        ... function ...

    There are shortucts for get, post, head, put, and delete.

    
    * Handling Wildcard URLs
    ------------------------

    Juno has a very simple URL matching scheme.  Right now there is just one special
    character: '*'.  It is used like this:

        @get('/hello/*:person/')
        def hello(web, person): ...

    This will match '/hello/brian/' and '/hello/112358/'.  The ':person' part lets us
    send the match as a named parameter to your function, which in the preceding 
    examples would be 'brian' and '112358'.

    Because '*' is the only matching character available now, you don't have to put
    it in:  '/*:greet/' is the same as '/:greet/'.


    * Shortcuts
    -----------

    Juno provides a couple shortcut functions to use with routes.  The first is a 
    redirection shortcut.  Instead of writing a function like this:
        
        @route('/')
        def temp(web): redirect('/home/')

    You can use the assign function instead:

        assign('/home/', '/')
        assign(['/index/', '/profile/'], '/')

    The next allows you to automatically render a template in response to a certain
    url:
        
        autotemplate('/about/', 'about.html')

    Like assign(), it also accepts a list of urls.
