** Juno Requests and Responses
==============================

    * Request Basics
    ----------------

        Every view in Juno must take a JunoRequest as the first argument.  This
        object gives you access to all of the information that the server 
        received - headers, GET and POST data, etc.

        If 'web' is a JunoRequest object created from an actual request:
            
            web.location        # '/'
            web.full_location   # '/?a=4'
            web.user_agent      # ...user-agent string...
            web.raw             # A dictionary mapping header names to their values
            web['REQUEST_URI']  # The Request can be used like a dictionary, to
                                # retrieve values from the raw dictionary.

        Data received from GET/POST requests is stored in web.input().  This
        would be query strings ('?a=4&b=5') and form data.  Currently Juno
        does not handle file uploads from forms, but thats at the top of the 
        todo list.

        To access this data:

            web.input()         # Returns a dictionary of GET/POST data

        To access a specific name ('a' in '?a=4'):
    
            web.input('a')      # Gets the value of the GET/POST key 'a'

        If multiple values have the same name (i.e. more than one input field
        sharing a name), they values are put in a list:
            
            web.input('b')      # => ['1', '2'] for '?b=1&b=2'


    * Response Basics
    -----------------

        Juno gives each view a global JunoResponse object when that view is 
        called.  You can define your own response object, but is often easier
        to use the functions that modify the global object.

        A response object is made up of 3 parts:
            
            body    => Text to send back
            status  => The HTTP status code
            headers => Dictionary of HTTP headers

        The easiest way to use a response object is through the global
        functions, which by default modify a JunoResponse object set to a 
        status of 200:

            append(text)       => Add text to the response.  Automatically 
                                  updates the Content-Length header.
            header(key, value) => Set a member of the headers dictionary.
            content_type(type) => Specify a Content-Type other than 'text/html'.
            status(code)       => Specify a response code other than 200.

        To return a 404 response:
            
            notfound(error, file) => Renders template with a 404 status.
                                     error defaults to 'Unspecified error'.
                                     file defaults to the value of Juno's
                                     '404_template' setting (which you can set
                                     when you call init).

        To return a 302 (redirect) response:
            
            redirect(url) => Sets the global response to a status of 302 with a 
                             'Location' header set to url.

        To return a 500 (server error) response:
            
            servererror(error, file) => Renders the 500_template. error defaults
                                        to 'Unspecified error'.

        To automatically assign urls, without creating a view to do it:
            
            assign(from, to) => Called from outside of a view, automatically
                                redirects the 'from' url to the 'to' url. 'from'
                                can be a list of urls.

    
    * Templates
    -----------

        This is probably the most common case of responses, and is covered in
        'doc/6-templates.txt'.

    
    * Static Files
    --------------

        Serving static files with Juno involves 3 configuration options:
            
            'static_url'     => The route that triggers static file serving.  If
                                you change this, you must include a '*:file' 
                                portion (unless you also change the static handler,
                                discussed below).  By default, it is set to
                                '/static/*:file/'.
            'static_root'    => The local directory that Juno looks for static
                                files.  By default, set to './static/'.
            'static_handler' => The view assigned to serve static files.  As noted
                                above, takes a 'file' parameter.  Maps this
                                filename to the 'static_root' directory.

        The built in static handler will automatically determine mimetypes for
        you, and will return a 404 if the file cannot be found.
