% TODOs may also be placed in source files.

Important:

[ ] Add authorization.
[ ] Write an intro tutorial (in progress)
[ ] Add sessions to documentation


Secondary:
    
[ ] Add other URL wildcards ('#' for numbers, '@' for letters)
[ ] Allow unnamed URL params
[ ] Allow URL parameters with the same name
[ ] Make sure internal code uses updated functions (i.e. config())
[ ] Decide if '/foo/*:bar/' should match '/foo/'
[ ] Add functionality to dev server to automatically reload changed files (as
    in Werkzeug's run_with_reloader)


Bugs:
    
[ ] Bug: Flup servers are not sending status/headers correctly - they are simply
    being prepended to the content by Firefox (thus text/html is displayed as
    plain text)
[ ] Bug: For a url set like '/:foo/' and '/:foo/bar/', if '/quux/bar/' is
    requested then the first pattern will match, with foo being 'quux/bar'
    (Same with '/:foo/' and '/bar/:foo/')
